# IPFS-API

This project provide a go wrapper to use the [IPFS api](https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/kubo/rpc/#getting-started).

The given [API](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipfs/kubo/client/rpc) developped by the IPFS team looks very difficult to use if not completely broken.

This API will remain as simple as possible, only used to interact with content on IPFS (upload, retrieve,...)
